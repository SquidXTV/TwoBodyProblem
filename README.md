# TwoBodySimulation
TwoBodySimulation is a simple simulation of two celestial bodies using the Euler method.
It provides a graphical visualization of the simulation using JavaFX.

## Usage
To use the simulation, you can download the provided executable or compile it yourself
from the source code. Once you have the program running, you can input the initial positions,
velocities, masses, and colors of both bodies using the GUI.

Additionally, you can change the time mode (one real time second is equal to one second, 
minute, hour, day, month, or year), slow mode (a factor of 10 slower than the selected time mode), 
and distance mode (full canvas equals one km, au, ly ...) to suit your needs.

The simulation comes with some presets like sun earth configuration, and contributors can create and add their
own presets via a pull request to the main branch.

## Output
The simulation output is displayed on a JavaFX canvas, showing the positions of both 
celestial bodies as they move over time.

I hope you enjoy using TwoBodySimulation and learning about celestial mechanics!
